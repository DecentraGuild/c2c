# Read Agent Index Before Starting

Before starting work on any prompt in this project:

1. **Read `Agent/INDEX.md`** at the start of the conversation.
2. Use its table and "Getting into work quickly" section to open the right docs for the task (e.g. file-locations, views-and-pages, constants-and-patterns).
3. Follow the **Critical rules** listed there (errors, logging, constants, debounce) and the project layout.

This keeps context aligned with project structure, naming, and patterns.
